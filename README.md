# hdlib

Collection of utilities I find useful.
Some are actually useful, others are reimplementations of standard library I do just for fun.

## Algorithms
- [x] min
- [x] max
- [x] gcd
- [x] reduce

## Containers
- [x] ordered_vector
- [x] small_vector
- [x] static_vector

## Build instructions

Using CMake:
```console
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
```

Using Bazel:
```console
$ bazel build //:hdlib
```
